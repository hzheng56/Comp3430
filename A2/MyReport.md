### Answers

**1. What happens if a signal handler gets invoked when it’s already handling a signal for that same signal/handler? For example, what happens when a process receives a signal for `SIGUSR1` when it’s already handling `SIGUSR1`?**

- **Program running result:** the child process always handle the first `SIGUSR1` received when two of `SIGUSR1` are sent from the parent process close together.

- **My viewpoint:** If a process receives a signal (i.e. `SIGUSR1`) that is identical to the signal that the user handler is already handling, then this later arrived signal will be sent to `SIG_DFL`. That is, user handler can only handle one same signal at one time.

- **Quote from `man`:** `when a handler that was established using signal() was invoked by the delivery of a signal, the disposition of the signal would be reset to SIG_DFL, and the system did not block delivery of further instances of the signal.`

**2. What happens if a signal handler gets invoked if the process is already handling a different signal? For example, what happens when a process receives a signal for `SIGUSR2` when it’s busy handling SIGUSR1? For example, what happens when a process receives a signal for SIGUSR2 when it’s busy handling `SIGUSR1`?**

- **Program running result:** the child process always handle `SIGUSR2` first when `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` are sent from the parent process close together.

- **My viewpoint:** `SIGUSR1` may be reserved for user handler. Therefore, when a process receives both `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` close together, the kernel will take over `SIGUSR2`. As the kernel checks for pending signals when it is about to return back to the user process, it will handle `SIGUSR2` then return back to the user process in order to handle `SIGUSR1`.

- **Quote from `man`:** `A signal may be process-directed because it was generated by the kernel for reasons other than a hardware exception, or because it was sent using kill(2) or sigqueue(3).`
